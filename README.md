# DeadShock
This is my game which I was making about 5 months with JavaFX. I know that it's not a good choice but I realized it too late so had to finish it with JavaFX <br><br>
This is source coude but for the launching you need jut folders data, images and + sounds/videos which I share with Google Drive here:<br>

<strong> Before launching make sure you have java(jre at least) which you can download here: </strong> <br>

Then you just need launch DeadShock.jar and then have fun ;) <br>
